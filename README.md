supply-ordering-system-prototype
================================

This repository contains a prototype of the application designed as a class project for Human Computer Interaction (CS 449) at the University of Waterloo. The purpose of this application is to address a breakdown we studied at a tea shop in the ordering process for supplies.

We are using SASS to generate our css files. To do so install SASS (Rails required) with the following command:

```
sudo gem install sass
```

And to generate the css files, execute:

```
sass --update sass:css
```
